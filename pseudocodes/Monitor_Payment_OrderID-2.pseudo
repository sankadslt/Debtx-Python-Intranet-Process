START Processing Order_Id 2

1. The program finds an order with Order_Id 2 in the database (like checking a to-do list for "Open" tasks).

2. It gets the request ID and account number from the order.

3. It checks if the account number and request ID are okay:
   - Account number must be text and not empty.
   - Request ID must be a number greater than 0.
   - If either is bad, it writes in the diary: "Invalid account number" or "Invalid request ID", counts 1 error, and stops.

4. It writes in the diary: "Processing payment monitoring for request ID X".

5. It starts the monitoring process:
   - It checks the account number and request ID again.
   - If invalid, it writes in the diary and stops.
   - It writes in the diary: "Processing monitoring request X for account Y".
   - It creates a monitoring record in the database (process_monitor_log) with:
     - Case ID, request ID, account number, current time, next check time (in 24 hours), status "Open", and a note "Initial monitoring setup".
   - If saving fails, it writes in the diary: "Failed to save monitoring record" and stops.
   - It gets the new monitoring ID (like a receipt number).
   - It creates a progress record (process_monitor_progress_log) with the same details.
   - If saving fails, it writes in the diary: "Failed to save progress record" and stops.
   - It copies extra details (like parameters) from the request to a details record (process_monitor_details).
   - If copying fails, it writes in the diary: "Failed to save details" and stops.
   - It updates two database files (request_progress_log and request_log) to mark the order as "Completed".
   - If updating fails, it writes in the diary: "Failed to update status" and stops.

6. It writes in the diary: "Successfully processed monitoring request X".

7. It counts 1 success if everything worked, or 1 error if something went wrong.

8. It writes in the diary: "Processed 1 success, 0 errors" (or "0 successes, 1 error").

9. It waits 1 second before moving to the next order.
