START Processing Order_Id 3

1. The program finds an order with Order_Id 3 in the database (like checking a to-do list for "Open" tasks).

2. It gets the request ID, account number, and case ID (a number tied to the monitoring) from the order.

3. It checks if the account number, request ID, and case ID are okay:
   - Account number must be text and not empty.
   - Request ID must be a number greater than 0.
   - Case ID must be text and not empty.
   - If any are bad, it writes in the diary: "Invalid account number", "Invalid request ID", or "Invalid case ID", counts 1 error, and stops.

4. It writes in the diary: "Processing cancellation for request ID X, account Y, case Z".

5. It starts the cancellation process:
   - It connects to the database.
   - It gets extra details for the request ID (like parameters).
   - If no details, it writes in the diary: "No details for request X" and stops.
   - It checks if a monitoring record exists for the case ID and account number.
   - If no record, it writes in the diary: "No monitoring record for case Z, account Y" and stops.
   - It gets the monitoring ID from the record.
   - It updates the progress record (process_monitor_progress_log) to set status to "Cancelled" with a note "Cancellation processed".
   - If updating fails, it writes in the diary: "Failed to update progress record" and stops.
   - It updates the monitoring record (process_monitor_log) to set status to "Cancelled" with the same note.
   - If updating fails, it writes in the diary: "Failed to update monitoring record" and stops.
   - It updates the details record (process_monitor_details) to keep only the first two parameters and clear the rest.
   - If updating fails, it writes in the diary: "Failed to update details" and stops.
   - It updates two database files (request_progress_log and request_log) to mark the order as "Completed".
   - If updating fails, it writes in the diary: "Failed to update status" and stops.

6. It saves all changes to the database.

7. It writes in the diary: "Successfully cancelled request X, account Y".

8. It counts 1 success if everything worked, or 1 error if something went wrong.

9. It writes in the diary: "Processed 1 success, 0 errors" (or "0 successes, 1 error").

10. It waits 1 second before moving to the next order.
