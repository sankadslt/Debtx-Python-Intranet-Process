START Processing Order_Id 4

1. The program finds an order with Order_Id 4 in the database (like checking a to-do list for "Open" tasks).

2. It gets the request ID, account number, and case ID from the order.

3. It checks if the account number, request ID, and case ID are okay:
   - Account number must be text and not empty.
   - Request ID must be a number greater than 0.
   - Case ID must be text and not empty.
   - If any are bad, it writes in the diary: "Invalid account number", "Invalid request ID", or "Invalid case ID", counts 1 error, and stops.

4. It writes in the diary: "Processing close monitor for request ID X, account Y, case Z".

5. It starts the closing process:
   - It connects to the database.
   - It creates a new monitoring record (process_monitor_log) with:
     - Case ID, request ID, account number, current time, next check time (in 24 hours), status "Closed", and a note "Monitor closed due to no transaction".
   - If saving fails, it writes in the diary: "Failed to save monitoring record" and stops.
   - It gets the new monitoring ID.
   - It creates a progress record (process_monitor_progress_log) with the same details.
   - If saving fails, it writes in the diary: "Failed to save progress record" and stops.
   - It copies extra details from the request to a details record (process_monitor_details).
   - If copying fails, it writes in the diary: "Failed to save details" and stops.
   - It updates two database files (request_progress_log and request_log) to mark the order as "Completed".
   - If updating fails, it writes in the diary: "Failed to update status" and stops.

6. It saves all changes to the database.

7. It writes in the diary: "Successfully closed monitor for request X".

8. It counts 1 success if everything worked, or 1 error if something went wrong.

9. It writes in the diary: "Processed 1 success, 0 errors" (or "0 successes, 1 error").

10. It waits 1 second before moving to the next order.
