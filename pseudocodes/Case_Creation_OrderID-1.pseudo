START Processing Order_Id 1

1. The program finds an order with Order_Id 1 in the database (like checking a to-do list for "Open" tasks).

2. It gets the request ID (a unique number for the task) and account number (like a customer’s ID).

3. It checks if the account number and request ID are okay:
   - Account number must be text and not empty (e.g., "ACC123" is okay, but "" or nothing is not).
   - Request ID must be a number greater than 0 (e.g., 123 is okay, but 0 or "abc" is not).
   - If either is bad, it writes in the diary: "Invalid account number" or "Invalid request ID" and stops.

4. It writes in the diary: "Processing case registration for request ID X".

5. It looks in the database for an incident ID (a number tied to the debt case) linked to the request ID.

6. If no incident ID is found, it writes in the diary: "No incident ID for request X" and stops.

7. It checks the account number and request ID again to be safe.

8. If they’re okay, it writes in the diary: "Starting to process case for account Y, incident Z, request X".

9. It starts the incident creation process:
   - It checks if the account number and incident ID are valid (same rules: account number is text, incident ID is a number > 0).
   - If invalid, it writes in the diary: "Invalid account or incident" and stops.
   - It creates a form with basic info (account number, incident ID, amount owed, date).
   - It looks up customer details in the database (like name, address, phone, email).
   - If no customer details, it writes in the diary: "No customer details for account Y" and stops.
   - It adds customer details to the form (name, address, contacts, account status).
   - It looks for the latest payment data (like the last payment made).
   - If payment data is found, it adds it to the form (payment amount, date).
   - If no payment data, it notes in the diary: "No payment data found" but continues.
   - It formats the form into a special data format (like a neatly typed report).
   - It gets the address of an external system (like a website to send the report to).
   - If no address, it writes in the diary: "No address to send report" and stops.
   - It sends the report to the external system.
   - If the system responds, it writes in the diary: "Successfully sent report".
   - If no response or an error, it writes in the diary: "Failed to send report" and stops.
10. If the incident is created successfully, it marks the order as "Completed" in two database files (request_progress_log and request_log).

11. If the incident fails, it marks them as "Error".

12. It writes in the diary: "Updated status to Completed for account Y, request X" (or "Error" if it failed).

13. If the database updates fail, it writes in the diary: "Failed to update status" and stops.

14. It counts 1 success if everything worked, or 1 error if something went wrong.

15. It writes in the diary: "Processed 1 success, 0 errors" (or "0 successes, 1 error").

16. It waits 1 second before moving to the next order.
